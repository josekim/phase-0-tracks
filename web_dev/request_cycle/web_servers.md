Virtual Private Server
A computer or virtual machine that can be used to host a server which is a program that takes request.  All of this is made privately or by one person

A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers may have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. For many purposes they are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server, and being software-defined, are able to be much more easily created and configured. They are priced much lower than an equivalent physical server. However, as they share the underlying physical hardware with other VPSs, performance may be lower, depending on the workload of any other executing virtual machines.

You can easily make or destroy these VPS, with not alot of problems.  Makes it easy to experiment and try things and not have alot of problems.  Its like digital cameras vs Film Cameras.  That cost of film is not a big deal,so now you can take as many pictures as you want and delete them and its not such a big deal.  Don't have to put in as much thought to them as you do with film.  

Bad idea to run things in root because its a super user and you can do some terrible terrible damage with some of the commands that are not available to other users.
