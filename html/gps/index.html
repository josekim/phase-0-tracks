What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  Semantic tags are use to break up the website in to understandable sections.  also its used to help people with impairments, forexample blind, to be able to navigate a page by understanding where all the content is.  It generally improves accessiblity of the document
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  from top to bottom?
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  Learned how to make snippets.  Seems helpful to make different start up pages later when we have different code, or when you are creating alot of modules that have the same boiler plate code
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  I think some of the semantics blend, forexample article and section blend it.  I think they seem to be interchangeable at times and it may just depend on the website you are using on how you use them.
