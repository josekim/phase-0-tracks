# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a way of know what has changed over the lifetime of your code.  Its useful so that you can quickly move from version to version especially if you have problems with the current version
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - Branch is a offshoot that is used to build new code off the master code.  It allows your to make changes to the code on your own without affecting other people, allowing multiple people to work on the same project without getting in each others way.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - Commit is when you would like to save the changes to the respository.  You put in a good commit message so that you can understand what features are being added.  With a commit it gives you a place to revert back to in your code if something goes wrong.  
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict is when multiple people are working on the same file and it is unclear to git which one takes priority over the other.  For example one user may add a line another may delete a line, and another user may delete the entire file.  It is unclearly to Git what to do, and it needs some human intervention to decide which way is correct.
